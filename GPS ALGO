Algorithm for GPS Data Parsing and Display:
Initialization:

Configure UART0 and UART1 using UART0Init() and UART1Init().
Set up UART0 for output and UART1 for receiving GPS data.
Wait for GPS Data Start:

Continuously read data from UART1 until the start character $ is detected.
Check for Valid Data:

Skip the next three characters.
If the next character is R:
Skip 15 more characters and check if the next character is V.
If V, output "Invalid GPS string" via UART0 and return to step 2.
Parse Latitude and Longitude:

Read and store the next 24 characters into an array (rcv_array).
The first 11 characters represent latitude.
Characters 12 to 23 represent longitude.
Display Parsed Data:

Send "Latitude=" followed by the first 11 characters of rcv_array via UART0.
Send "Longitude=" followed by the next 12 characters of rcv_array via UART0.
Repeat:
