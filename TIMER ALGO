Algorithm for LED Blinking Program using LPC214x Timer:
Initialize Timer:

Configure Timer 0 (T0PR) for a prescale value to generate a 1 millisecond delay.
Reset the Timer Counter (T0TC) to 0 before starting the timer.
Set GPIO Pins as Output:

Configure IO1DIR to set Port 1 pins as output by writing 0xFFFFFFFF (all pins as output).
Infinite Loop for LED Blinking:

In each iteration:
Turn on the LEDs by setting high bits on IOSET1 (0xFF000000 for the higher byte of Port 1).
Call the delay function for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
Turn off the LEDs by clearing the bits on IOCLR1.
Call the delay function for another 1000 milliseconds.
Delay Function:

Start the timer (T0TCR = 0x01).
Wait until the Timer Counter (T0TC) matches the desired millisecond delay.
Stop the timer (T0TCR = 0x00) once the delay is achieved.
