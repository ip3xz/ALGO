Algorithm for ADC Reading and UART Communication
ADC Initialization:

Configure ADC input pin (P0.28) and set up ADC control register for conversion.
UART Initialization:

Set up UART0 for communication (baud rate, line control, etc.).
Start ADC Conversion:

Trigger ADC conversion by setting the control register.
Wait for Conversion:

Wait until the ADC conversion is complete.
Read and Convert Data:

Extract the 10-bit ADC result and convert it to hexadecimal ASCII.
Transmit Data via UART:

Send the ASCII values of the ADC result over UART.
Repeat Process:
