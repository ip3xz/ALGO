Algorithm for Transmitting and Receiving Single Character:
Initialization:

Configure the pins for UART0 using PINSEL0 register.
Enable and reset the UART FIFO using U0FCR.
Set the baud rate by configuring U0DLL and U0DLM.
Configure the data format (8-bit data, 1 stop bit, no parity) using U0LCR.
Transmission and Reception:

Receive a character:
Wait until the Receiver Data Ready (U0LSR & 0x01) is set.
Read the received data from U0RBR.
Transmit a character:
Wait until the Transmitter Holding Register Empty (U0LSR & 0x20) is set.
Write the data to be transmitted to U0THR.
End of Program:

Exit the main loop or continue the process as required.

Algorithm for Transmitting and Receiving String:
Initialization:

Configure the data format (8-bit data, 1 stop bit, no parity) using U0LCR.
Main Loop (Transmit and Receive):

Receive a character:
Wait until the Receiver Data Ready (U0LSR & 0x01) is set.
Read the received data from U0RBR.
Echo back the received character:
Wait until the Transmitter Holding Register Empty (U0LSR & 0x20) is set.
Write the received data to U0THR.
Repeat the process in a loop until a termination condition (like receiving a newline) is met.
End of Program:

Exit the loop or continue handling other tasks.
